          Following the Excavation
        </h1>
        <h2>
          Mozia provides extensive archaeological evidence of the production of
          Phoenician and Punic pottery. In the north-east quarter of the island,
          four different potters' workshops have been identified. This includes
          one found by G. Whitaker near the North Gate, as well as a kiln
          excavated near a tower on the eastern side, another workshop excavated
          just south of the early cemeter, and the “Ker-ameikos” of Area K
          excavated by UNIPA in 1977-1994. Area K stands as a structural example
          of Punic industrial workshops during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The
          UNIPA team uncovered a large inner courtyard surrounded by a mud-brick
          enclosure. There was a row of rooms at the rear, and attached to one
          was a staircase that led to some sort of upper floor or terrace. They
          found "deep rock-cut wells, stone vats, clay basins, pure clay
          deposits, rows of up turned Punic amphoras, unbaked pots and
          loom-weights, raw materials and other installations for clay
          levigation and vessel preparation." Moreover, two kilns were excavated
          and identified as being similar in structure to those of Phoenicia and
          Iron-Age Palestine: omega shaped with bilobate combustion chambers. It
          is near one of these larger kilns that this most recent kiln was
          found.
