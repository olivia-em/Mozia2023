     <h2>
          As stated on the home page, my responsibilities on Mozia revolved
          around the photogrammetic modeling of the excavations and features
          inside of them. Every morning I would fly a drone over N23, N15, N27,
          and K64, producing about 50-100 pictures for each. Similary,
          throughout the day I would use a camera to take pictures of individual
          features inside each area, which you can see me doing with the kiln in
          the above left photo. Using a total station, which is essentially a
          gps that can be accurate down to the centimeter, the archaeologists
          would take points in their areas, and I would use those points to
          integrate geographic data into the models. So, in the afternoons, I
          would take all the images and GPS points and run them through
          Metashape, which is a software for photogrammetry. For the larger
          areas, I made orthomosaics, which are images produced by creating a
          mosaic from a collection of photos. These images are data heavy,
          detailed, and carry geographic data, meaning they can be be mapped in
          a GIS software. You can see lighter versions of these on the home
          page, as well as in the timelapse above, which shows all of the daily
          orthomosaics for the kiln. For orthomosaics, it's the birds' eye view
          that is the most important to capture, but for the 3D models shown
          below, there needs to be a different technique. Throughout the dig, I
          also worked on 3D modeling smaller features such as pottery,
          cremations, and the kiln. For 3D modeling, you need to take pictures
          from every angle and close enough to capture finer details. Each photo
          needs a two-thirds overlap with the one before and after, so the
          images can be pieced together accurately. From there, building the
          model just takes time.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Photogrammetry can be beneficial to archaeological science in a number
          of ways. Excavation is inherently a destructive act; once things are
          unearthed, it can't be undone. Context for finds can easily be lost,
          and without good records, it's difficult to go back and look for
          information. The north-east sector of the island is a good example of
          this phenomena, because UNIPA's goal is to gather certain information
          that previous excavations did not. So, it is really important to
          record everthing, at every stage, and photogrammetry can make detailed
          documentation easier. The results are often more accurate than a
          description or drawing. Moreover, when you visit a museum or even tour
          archaeological ruins, you are always seeing artifacts or structures
          post-excavation, often removed from the context in which they were
          found. The beauty of photogrammetry is that 3D models, if done well,
          can get you as close to an in-person experience as possible, allowing
          you to see artifacts or features in situ, throughout their excavation.
          This could be useful to the archaeologists who need to look back on
          their work, scholars who need to research otherwise inaccessible
          materials, or the person who has an interest in the history, but can't
          get to it.

          So, for those with an interest, here's the kiln that was exacavated in
          K64.

          Following the Excavation
        </h1>
        <h2>
          As a potters' workshop, Area K is full of things relating to this type
          of industry, whether that's amphorae, clay deposits, unbaked pottery,
          or kilns (of which there are a few). This kiln was discovered just
          north of a larger one that had been previously excavated. However, it
          started at a deeper level in the earth and was partially cut off by
          its larger counterpart, so it is certainly older. The circle of bricks
          making up the outer wall made it distinguishable from the surrounding
          earth. Initially, just a section of the kiln was dug, preserving the
          layers of the fill for the purposes of dating, record keeping, and
          chemical tests. Being able to look at the stratification of earth and
          the artifacts that may be in each layer can help with answering
          certain questions like, for example, when and why the kiln was filled
          in. However, the archaeologists reached a layer containing large jars,
          which are likely transport amphorae, which extended into the undug
          section. In order to dig deeper, the amphorae have to be completely
          recorded in situ and then removed for conservation. This meant that
          they would need to dig the other section to reach the layer with the
          amphorae. Once that was done, they continued to follow the section all
          the way down.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          In the models above, you can first see the kiln at the initial stage
          of excavation, with just the beginning of a section. The second model
          shows the kiln 10 days later, with the amphorae exposed. The last
          model shows the kiln about a week later, at the end of the excavation.
          At the bottom of the page, there's a model of the kiln at the end of
          the season displayed from the side. When you rotate it, you can see
          the color variation and layers in the brick as though from the inside.
          The kiln will most likely continue to be excavated next summer. Since
          it is very much an open exacavation that could be damaged/contaminated
          if left open to the elements, it had to be filled in with things that
          could later be removed.

        <h2>
          There's so much more about this kiln that I don't have the knowledge
          to elaborate on, especially because it is newly excavated and
          unpublished. I'd like to expand on this project, whether it is for the
          kiln or in some different iteration. To develop something like this at
          the side of an expert would be ideal, however when I had them more
          easily available to me, I hadn't fully decided on the focus of the
          project, let alone had the site developed. However, I think this shows
          the potential of presenting accessible digital archaeology. Not only
          can it be more of an immersive experience, it can also display history
          from a different angle and show how material culture can answer
          questions about the past as well as any book.
