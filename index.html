            Covers to hold in sacred Angels and all evil Spirits and the tongue
            of impious Amulet-spirits. Now you are conquered, you are charmed;
            charmed, you are charmed and sealed in each one of the four (2)
            corners of his house. <br /><br />
            You shall not sin against Pabak bar Kiifithai, nor shall any do
            folly against him, against all the people of his house, either by
            night nor (3) by day; because I have bound you with an evil charm
            and a sure [seal]. Again, I have charmed you with the charm with
            which Enoch was charmed by his wicked brothers. Again I charm you
            with an evil and galling seal. <br /><br />
            Again, (4) I charm you with the seal with which were charmed the
            Seven Stars and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac unto the great day
            (5) of judgment, and to the great hour of the redemption of your
            heads : you shall not . . , nor sin against them, against Abiina bar
            Geribta, and none shall at all do folly against them, namely the
            people of the household of Pabak (6) b. K., neither by night nor by
            day, because well sealed is his house and well armed, and with a
            great wall of bronze have I surrounded it.<br /><br />
            I, what I desire I grasp, and what I ask I take. (7) You are in the
            place of Abuna b. G. and in the place of Pabak b. K.

            Illustration is of a sorcerer waving his bough to ward off the
            demons. Normally there would be a bound demon in the center, but
            this is not entirely uncommon. This use of the bough is found in
            Babylonian magic, in which a branch of the datepalm or tamarisk was
            held aloft to repel the demons.

            The writing on the back is the object number, added when it was
            acquired by the museum. While this specific bowl is not on display,
            there are a few others (B16023, B2945, and B13186) that can be seen
            in the Eastern Mediterranean gallery.

            This bowl is made up of 5 fragments that have been glued together or
            filled in, and it has 11 lines of inscription. The inscription is a
            general protective spell, and it also clearly states that the bowl
            is meant to be placed in the corner of a household. The name, Pabak,
            appears in another bowl in the Penn Museum’s collection.
