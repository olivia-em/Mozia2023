      <h1><i>An Aramaic Incantation Bowl</i></p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>
        Excavated from Nippur in 1888, there are 290 incantation bowls housed at
        the Penn Museum, 5 of which are on display. They are typically the size
        of a cereal bowl, but a few have been found to be much larger. A
        protective spell is often inscribed around the inside, written in one of
        three Eastern Aramaic dialects: Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Syriac, and
        Mandaic. However, there are some inscribed with a pseudo-script. Many
        have images of bound demons in the center, and they can be specific to
        the incantation or entirely unrelated. Incantation bowls would be buried
        upside down under the floors of houses in specific locations, such as
        underneath doorways and in the corners of rooms, all in order to protect
        the family against demons and harmful magic. In some cases, two bowls
        would be buried rim to rim and sealed, while others have been found in
        burial places. These bowls have the ability to reveal information about
        various ancient demographics, as scribes from a range of social,
        educational, and religious backgrounds wrote these incantations.
        Moreover, there are explicit family names inscribed, sometimes on
        multiple bowls, leading to the possibility of tracking the relationships
        and interests of families and scribes. Bowls tend to mix imagery and
        ideas from many cultures and religious practices, and they assert that
        magic in the ancient world was not as separate from normal life as has
        been assumed.

            Illustration is of a sorcerer waving his bough to ward off the
            demons. Normally there would be a bound demon in the center, but
            this is not entirely uncommon. This use of the bough is found in
            Babylonian magic, in which a branch of the datepalm or tamarisk was
            held aloft to repel the demons.

            acquired by the museum. While this specific bowl is not on display,
            there are a few others (B16023, B2945, and B13186) that can be seen
            in the Eastern Mediterranean gallery.

            This bowl is made up of 5 fragments that have been glued together or
            filled in, and it has 11 lines of inscription. The inscription is a
            general protective spell, and it also clearly states that the bowl
            is meant to be placed in the corner of a household. The name, Pabak,
            appears in another bowl in the Penn Museum’s collection.
